The store should have vents or fans to allow fresh air to enter and stale air to exit.\n\nDryness: Most pests prefer humid conditions, so a dry store is less attractive to them. The store should be free from leaks, and the walls and floor should be made of materials that do not absorb moisture.\n\nCleanliness: A clean store reduces the likelihood of pest infestation. Any spilled grain or produce should be promptly cleaned up, and the store should be regularly swept and sanitized.\n\nPest monitoring: Regular inspection of stored crops is essential to detect any signs of pest infestation early. Traps or baits can be used to monitor and control pests.\n\nPest control: If pests are detected, appropriate control measures should be taken immediately. This can include the use of insecticides, fumigation, or physical removal of infested crops.\n\nProper storage containers: Crops should be stored in appropriate containers, such as airtight containers, to prevent pests from entering. The containers should be made of materials that do not release harmful chemicals or odors that can affect the quality of the stored crops.\n\nProper storage location: The store should be located away from sources of pests, such as animal pens or garbage dumps.
